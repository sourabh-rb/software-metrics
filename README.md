-------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project is to calculate several software metrices and to define correlation between them.

## We calculated following metrices.


1. **Statement Coverage:** Statement coverage is a white box testing technique, which involves the execution of all the statements at least once in the source code. It is a metric, which is used to calculate and measure the number of statements in the source code which have been executed.
2. **Branch Coverage:** ranch coverage is a testing method, which aims to ensure that each one of the possible branch from each decision point is executed at least once and thereby ensuring that all reachable code is executed.
3. **Mutation Score:** Mutation testing is used to design new software tests and evaluate the quality of existing software tests.
4. **Cyclomatic Complexity: McCabe Complexity** Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. 
5. **Package Instability** : This metric is used to measure the relative susceptibility of class to changes. According to the definition instability is the ration of outgoing dependencies to all package dependencies and it accepts value from 0 to 1.
6. **Post Release Defect Density** : Defect Density is the number of defects confirmed in software/module during a specific period of operation or development divided by the size of the software/module. It enables one to decide if a piece of software is ready to be released.
